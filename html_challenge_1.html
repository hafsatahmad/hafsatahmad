      <h1>Digital Dream</h1>
      <p>In circuits woven, futures glow, 
Where pixels pulse, and data flows. 
A symphony of ones and zeros, 
Building worlds, where faith finds heroes. 
Screens alight with vibrant hues, 
A canvas vast, where we can choose, 
To travel realms, both near and far, 
With just a touch, we raise the bar. </p>
